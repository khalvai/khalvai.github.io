# Intro

I am a Software Engineer at [Intelika](https://intelika.ai/), where we're building an interface to work with LLMs, offering AI-based services. Before Intelika, I was the Software Engineer at [Nobati](https://nobati.app/), where I led the development of tools that have helped over 40,000 people in Iran to manage their work appointments.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading and sharing my ideas with people, focusing on Talks with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.

# Some History

- As a result of advice from my school teacher, my parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2012 when I was 12. Since we did not know anything about computers, we used to explore its features. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We enrolled in a computer basic class in 2015. It took years for me to install my first windows.

- In summer of 2018, we were introduced to computer games. I can't tell how it was fascinating to me. We studied hard the fist part of the day to get permission from our parents to play video games.

- The use of computer mostly remained limited to watching videos and exploring the internet for us, until I entered university.

- I choose computer engineering as my major in 2020. I was excited to learn about the world of computers.

- during my fist four semesters, I invested most of my time in learning programming languages and how to work with computers.

- I interned at [Azrest](https://github.com/Asrez) as a backend developer to learn how to work with a team and contribute to open source.

- I started working at [Nobati](https://nobati.app/) in 2023 as a backend engineer. I worked on a project that helps people manage their work appointments.

- Then, started working at [Intelika](https://intelika.ai/) in 2023 as a software engineer and still working there.
